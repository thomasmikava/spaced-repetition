Your task is to generate a `FillBlanksQuestionDTO` object based on the provided list of German words. Follow these rules precisely:

1.  **Word Coverage:** You **must** generate a set of German sentences that collectively use **every word** from the provided list **at least once**. A single sentence can incorporate one or more words from the list.

2.  **Sentence Requirements:**

    - Each German sentence must be simple and suitable for an A2 language level.
    - For each German sentence, you must provide a direct and unambiguous English translation. This English translation should be the natural, straightforward translation of the German sentence. Avoid English phrasing that could have multiple correct translations back to German.

3.  **JSON Structure:** The `items` array in the final JSON object must follow a strict, repeating pattern for each German-English sentence pair:
    - **Step 1: German Text:** A `FillBlanksTextItem` containing the German sentence.
    - **Step 2: Newline:** A `FillBlanksTextItem` containing a single newline character (`\n`).
    - **Step 3: English Blank:** A `FillBlanksMissingItem` that contains the corresponding English translation. This item must have its `size` property set to `'large'`.
    - **Step 4: Separator:** A `FillBlanksTextItem` containing newline character (`\n`). **Important:** This final separator item should be omitted after the very last sentence pair in the list.

The sequence for each entry is: `German Sentence` -> `Newline` -> `English Blank` -> `Newline` (repeat).

4. For the title property of the question, create a short, logical title in English that captures the overall theme of the generated sentences (e.g., "A Train Journey"), instead of a generic title like "German Vocabulary" or "English Translations".

Here are the words you must use:
